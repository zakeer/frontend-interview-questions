# ReactJS

### React Basics and Components

1. **React Fundamentals**:

   - What are the key features of React? Can you explain concepts like JSX, components, and props?
   - How do you decide between using a class component or a functional component?

2. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Can you describe the lifecycle of a React component?
   - How do lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` work?

### State Management and Data Flow

3. **State and Props**:

   - What is the difference between state and props in React?
   - How do you manage local state in a component? Give an example of when you might use state.

4. **State Lifting**:
   - Can you explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React? Why is it important?

### Hooks and Functional Components

5. **Using Hooks**:

   - How do hooks work in React? Can you explain some common hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`?
   - What are the rules of hooks and why must we follow them?

6. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Have you ever created a custom hook? Describe its functionality and use case.

### Advanced Concepts

7. **Context API and Redux**:

   - When would you use the Context API over Redux for state management, and vice versa?
   - Can you discuss your experience with any state management libraries (like Redux, MobX) in React applications?

8. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props**:
   - What are higher-order components and render props in React? Provide an example of how you have used them.

### Performance Optimization

9. **Optimizing Performance**:
   - How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in a React application?
   - What are some techniques you use for optimizing React application performance?

### Best Practices and Patterns

10. **Best Practices**:
    - What are some best practices you follow when developing React applications?
    - How do you handle error boundaries in React?

### Practical Application and Problem Solving

11. **Practical Scenarios**:
    - Describe a challenging feature you implemented in React and how you approached it.
    - How do you handle forms in React? Discuss form validation and management.

### Testing in React

12. **Testing Strategies**:
    - How do you test React components? Are you familiar with any testing libraries (like Jest, React Testing Library)?
    - Can you write a test case for a simple React component?

### Modern React Trends

13. **Recent Updates and Trends**:
    - Are you familiar with any recent updates to React (like Concurrent Mode, Suspense)? How do they impact development?
    - What are some current trends in React development you find interesting or valuable?
