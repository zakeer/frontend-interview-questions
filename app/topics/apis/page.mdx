# Client and Server-side communication using APIs

### 1. Basic Understanding of API Communication

- **API Fundamentals**: Can you explain what an API is and how it facilitates communication between the client and server?
- **RESTful Services**: What are the principles of RESTful API design? Can you describe what makes an API RESTful?

### 2. HTTP Methods and Status Codes

- **HTTP Methods**: What are the different HTTP methods, and when would you use each one in API interactions?
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Can you explain some common HTTP status codes and what they signify in API communication?

### 3. Data Handling and Formats

- **Data Formats**: In what formats can API responses be received? What are the pros and cons of formats like JSON and XML?
- **Parsing Data**: How do you parse and handle data received from an API on the client side?

### 4. Security in API Communication

- **Authentication and Authorization**: How do you implement secure API calls, particularly with respect to authentication and authorization?
- **Common Security Risks**: What are common security risks associated with API communication and how do you mitigate them?

### 5. API Testing and Documentation

- **Testing APIs**: What tools and techniques do you use for testing APIs?
- **API Documentation**: How important is API documentation, and what tools do you recommend for creating effective documentation?

### 6. Error Handling and Debugging

- **Handling API Errors**: How do you handle errors in API communication on the client side?
- **Debugging API Issues**: Can you describe your approach to debugging issues in API communication?

### 7. Performance Considerations

- **Optimizing API Calls**: What strategies do you employ to optimize API requests and responses for performance?
- **Caching Strategies**: How do you implement caching for API responses? What are the benefits?

### 8. Real-world Scenarios

- **Challenging API Integration**: Describe a challenging API integration you worked on. What made it challenging and how did you address those challenges?
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: How do you handle API rate limiting or throttling in a client application?

### 9. Advanced Topics

- **WebSockets and Real-time Communication**: Can you compare traditional HTTP API communication with WebSockets for real-time communication?
- **Microservices and API Gateways**: How do APIs fit into microservices architectures? What is the role of an API Gateway?

### 10. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- **CORS Concepts**: What is CORS, and why is it important in client-server API communication?
- **Handling CORS Issues**: How do you resolve CORS issues when they arise in web applications?
