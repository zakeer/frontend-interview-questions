# JSON

### 1. JSON Basics

- **JSON Structure**: What is JSON and how does its structure differ from XML?
- **JSON Syntax**: Can you explain the basic syntax rules of JSON? What data types are supported in JSON?

### 2. Working with JSON

- **Parsing and Stringifying**: How do you parse JSON in JavaScript? What does `JSON.stringify()` do, and when would you use it?
- **Handling Large JSON Files**: What strategies would you use to handle and process large JSON files efficiently?

### 3. Data Exchange and APIs

- **API Communication**: How is JSON used in web APIs? Can you give an example of a RESTful API call that sends or receives JSON data?
- **HTTP Methods**: What are the different HTTP methods you might use when working with a REST API? How are they typically used in conjunction with JSON?

### 4. Security Considerations

- **Security Risks**: What are some security risks when handling JSON data, especially when it comes from an external source?
- **Preventing Injection**: How can you prevent JSON injection attacks in web applications?

### 5. JSON and Modern Web Development

- **JSON in Web Frameworks**: How do modern web frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue handle JSON data?
- **JSON vs. Other Formats**: In what scenarios might you use JSON over other data formats, or vice versa?

### 6. Serialization and Deserialization

- **Concepts of Serialization**: Can you explain the concepts of serialization and deserialization? How are they implemented with JSON in a web application?
- **Date Handling**: How do you handle date and time values in JSON, considering JSON itself does not have a date type?

### 7. JSON Schema

- **Validating JSON Data**: Are you familiar with JSON Schema? How would you use it to validate JSON data structure?

### 8. Performance Optimization

- **Optimizing Data Transfer**: What techniques would you use to optimize JSON data transfer in a web application?

### 9. Real-world Usage

- **Practical Application**: Can you describe a scenario from your past projects where you effectively used JSON for data exchange?

### 10. Advanced Concepts

- **Data Transformation**: How would you transform JSON data structures, for example, converting an array of objects into a different structure?
- **Nested JSON Objects**: How do you handle deeply nested JSON objects in JavaScript?
